# SplittableMadness
This was a project for IST 242
For this project I had to create a GUI and display 2 lists one right and left.
In the GUI there is a textbox to type an object in to perform tasks.
Once typed you have a button to add the typed word to the right list,
a button to remove the word from the right list, a button to move the cursor forward,
a button to move the cursor to the beginning of the lists, a button to clear the lists,
and a button to get the count of whatever word it typed into the text box. Under the 
text box 3 things are always kept track of the length of the left list, the length of the
right list, and the last removed item which will read N/A if nothing has been removed since
running the program.
